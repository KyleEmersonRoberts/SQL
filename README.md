# SQL
Using a test database imported into mysql, I set up these scripts to analyze the following metrics of success

- Highest average salary over the timeline of the employee
- Highest total income
- Highest average salary growth over a period of at least three years
- Shortest time between title changes, implicating quick promotions

The Demographics script is the most complex, bringing together all the demographic information in a new table 
that's referenced by the other scripts

I also created a dashboard in Excel that brings pivot tables, charts and slicers to visualize and summerize the resulting tables.
